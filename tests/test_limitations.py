"""Negative tests that document known gaps in the analysis.

Each case asserts the *current* edge set and includes a comment about
the ideal behaviour. When the analyser is improved these tests will
start producing the commented-out edges and will begin to fail -- that
is the signal to promote them into ``test_declarations`` or
``test_imports``.
